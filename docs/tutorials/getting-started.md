# Getting started
  - Download or clone the [source-code example folder](https://github.com/lenacassandre/sunrays/example) and rename it how you feel like naming it :)
  - Declare a `SECRET` variable in a `.env` file at the root folder of your project
  - Run `yarn install`
  - Run `yarn watch`
  - You're set! Why not get your hands on the concepts of the library and practice by reading our [getting started guide?](https://github.com/lenacassandre/sunrays/docs/gettingstarted/md)
